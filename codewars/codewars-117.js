/*
Although shapes can be very different by nature, they can be sorted by the size of their area.

Task:

Create different shapes that can be part of a sortable list. The sort order is based on the size of their respective areas:
The area of a Square is the square of its side
The area of a Rectangle is width multiplied by height
The area of a Triangle is base multiplied by height divided by 2
The area of a Circle is the square of its radius multiplied by Ï€
The area of a CustomShape is given

The default sort order of a list of shapes is ascending on area size:
let side = 1.1234;
let radius = 1.1234;
let base = 5;
let height = 2;

let shapes = [ new Square(side)
             , new Circle(radius)
             , new Triangle(base, height)
             ];
shapes.sort( (a,b) => Number(a>b)-Number(a<b) ); // instead of the default lexicographical sort, natural sort will be used
Use the correct Ï€ constant for your circle area calculations:
Math.PI

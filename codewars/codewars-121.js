Coding with Squared Strings

A squared string has n lines, each substring being n characters long: For example:

s = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop" is a squared string of size 4.

We will use squared strings to code and decode texts. To make things easier we suppose that our original text doesn't include the character '\n'.

Coding
Input:

a text t of length l.
Consider the smallest integer n such that n * n be greater or equal to l.
Complete t with the char of ascii code 11 (we suppose that this char is not in our original text) until the length of t is n * n.
From now on we can transform the new t in a squared string s of size n by inserting '\n' where needed.
Apply a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to s: that's it for the coding part.
Decoding
Input:

a squared string s resulting from the coding
Apply a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees to s
Do some cleaning to have the original text t
You can see clockwise rotation of 90 degrees: http://www.codewars.com/kata/56dbeec613c2f63be4000be6 
You can see counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees: http://www.codewars.com/kata/56dbf59b0a10feb08c000227

Example:
t = "I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock"

code(t) -> "c.nhsoI\nltiahi.\noentinw\ncng.nga\nk..mg.s\n\voao.f.\n\v'trtig"

decode(code(t)) == "I.was.going.fishing.that.morning.at.ten.o'clock"

(Dots indicate spaces since they are quite invisible).

Notes:
Swift : character 11 is replaced by "\u{F7}" (ie "รท" - alt 246 -)

Ocaml : character 11 is replaced by '&'

Perl : character 11 is replaced by '&'

Fortran: Your returned string for both functions are not permitted to contain 
redundant leading/trailing whitespace. In return, you may safely assume 
that all input strings passed into your function(s) will not contain
 redundant leading/trailing whitespace, i.e. you do not and should not trim the input string before operating on it

Don't use this coding to keep your secrets:-)
